# MyMemoGame

Memory Game Project
About the project
This is one of my Project which I made in Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. This is a basic memory game with some extra functions, such as move counter, timer. The user could restart the game at any time, and after a winning game also could choose if starting a new game or not.

The basic memory game is working as other matching games. The player should click on a card, then the content will be displayed, the player choose the second card, and then the program check if they are a pair, or not. If the cards are the same, then these two cards become unclickable and lock on the screen. If the cards do not match, they are turn back and the player could click on them again.

A player win if he found all of the pairs.
